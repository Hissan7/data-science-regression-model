# A group of regression models using ensemble methods 

This repository contains the complete implementation for the 5CCSAMLF CW1 Data Science Challenge, which involves training and evaluating regression models on a simulated tabular dataset. The objective is to predict a continuous outcome variable using numerical and categorical features while maximising out-of-sample predictive performance.
The project follows a full, reproducible data science pipeline including exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model comparison, model selection, evaluation via cross-validation, and generation of final test-set predictions.
